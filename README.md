# IST146_Module04_HOA

By now, you have read about inheritance, polymorphism, and Java interfaces, watched some lecture videos on these topics, and have taken an assessment quiz to test your understanding. Now it is time to get your hands on with these concepts! In this module's HOA, you will write some client code to simulate the classic "Tortoise vs. Hare" race!

## Instructions

1. Log on to your replit account. 
2. Click the "+ New repl" button to create a new repl. 
3. Click on the "Import from GitHub" tab. 
4. Type or paste the following URL into the "Paste any repository URL" text field: `github.com/mmeysenburg/IST146_Module04_HOA`
5. Click on the "Import from github" button.
6. Click the "Done" button in the ".replit" dialog that appears.
7. From the "Console" tab, enter the following command: `rm .replit` *If you omit this step, the "Run" button will not work as it should!*
8. Select the `PolymorphismController.java` file. Search for the keyword "TODO", and write the specified code.
9. At any time you can run the code from the user's perspective, or, from a developer's point of view, execute the unit tests that have been provided.
  * To run the code, click the "Run" button.
  * To execute the unit tests (if any), enter the following command in the "Console" tab: `bash test.sh`
10. Once you have completed the code correctly, the unit tests (if any) should pass, and running the code should produce results that make sense.
11. When you are finished, submit your `PolymorphismController.java` file via the Canvas assignment.

## Files in the repository
